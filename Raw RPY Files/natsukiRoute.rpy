    n "As I was saying, I would argue with him a lot about how I was treated. It wasn't only neglect that was the problem, it was how he acted towards other things, too."
    n "He had this perfect idea of what he wanted his daughter to be like. He was willing to give some leeway, but not enough to let me do things like keep my manga collection at home."
    mc "He wanted to have that much control over your life when he could barely take care of himself?"

    "What she had been going through is not how someone should have to live."
    n "Because he wanted me to be the best daughter ever, that's what he taught me for years to do."
    n "He wanted me to rise above everyone else."
    n 12be "And, yeah, wanting me to be successful is one thing, but..."
    mc "He didn't have to push it onto you as hard as he did, right?"
    n "Yeah. And it wasn't exactly him focusing on only my grades, either."
    n "I've never been good enough at school to be a straight A student anyway."
    n "He told me to be the best socially, too, and to have the most friends."
    n "That even though it might not always work out, to make sure to try to talk to people."
    n "I never figured out what to do. I never wanted to figure out if I should take advice from him of all people."
    n "It didn't really matter, though. In the end, I had a hard time making friends, because I had trouble trusting people thanks to him."
    "..."
    "I can't even think right now. My mind is frozen."
    "..."
    n "Like I said, I didn't want to end up the way I did."
    n "Things just happened that way. Sometimes I'd be try to be nice, but a lot of times I didn't want to show any weakness."
    n "I don't get why it happened that way, but it did."
    "Natsuki pauses, taking a deep breath. Remembering all this can't be easy."
    n "I think the reason why he was so obsessed with me being successful is because of himself."
    n 12bd "I think he didn't want me to turn out the way he did."

    mc "Natsuki."
    mc "Do you still care for him?"
    "Natsuki thought long and hard about that question, as we sat in complete silence."
    n "A part of me does."
    mc "Okay, let me make sure we're on the same page here."
    mc "What your dad did to you is abuse."
    mc "I need to make something clear. Another one of his actions was undeniable, unjustifiable neglect towards you."
    mc "How do you fully feel about him? Just, think of everything, Natsuki."
    "I give Natsuki a few minutes while I wait for her to come up with an answer."
    "Learning all this is so surreal. It's like when you know something's wrong, but only later realize the extent of how awful it is."
    "I think it's funny how this turned out. Not that kind of funny, but I'm talking more about how I came to find out about this."
    "Natsuki seemed bent on not letting me find out about this situation. She didn't always do a great job, but she continued to try hiding it."
    "But then there's tonight. Because my bed is up against the wall, you can only fall off of it if you lay down on the left side."
    "I was the first one to get into bed that night, and I laid down on the right side."
    "So, the only option was for Natsuki to lay down on the left side."
    "If that didn't happen, she wouldn't have fallen off the bed, I wouldn't have seen her bruise, and I never would've learned the truth behind all this."
    "I know I was trying to give Natsuki time to think, but a thought crossed my mind."
    mc "Did your dad ever try to take his life?"
    n 12bc "Huh?"
    mc "I asked if your dad tried committing suicide at any point."
    n "He hasn't."
    mc "I'm trying to figure something out."
    mc "You said that he distanced himself from everyone, and that you think it was because he was sick of life piling up on him, right?"
    mc "He lost his wife, his financial situation was rough, and so on."
    n "I think so."
    mc "Would he have tried to take his life?"
    mc "I'm sorry if that sounds random, but it's something I was thinking about."
    mc "He had to have some reason to live, wouldn't he?"
    n "Or you're looking too deep into it."
    mc "No, I think I'm onto something."
    mc "Otherwise it leaves only two possibilities: there was another reason he distanced himself from everyone, or he had no reason to live."
    mc "There's nothing pointing to the first possibility and I don't think it'd make sense if there was, either. As for the second possibility, he hadn't even attempted suicide, right?"
    n 12bg "Again, you're looking way too deep into it."
    n "You can't tell how someone is feeling when you don't know them well enough."
    n "It's just not possible."
    mc "I also remember you suggesting that it was possible the reason your dad was so obsessed with you being successful was because he didn't want to see you end up like himself."
    mc "What if he kept living for you?"
    mc "If it were true then it would be a twisted, sick way to convey love when you look at how he treated you."
    mc "But even with how angry I am at him, I can't totally ignore that maybe that was the situation."
    "I'm even more conflicted now. There is absolutely no justifying his actions, and violence is never the answer, but maybe I really am looking at this from the wrong perspective."
    "Perhaps there is no {i}right{/i} perspective to this, either."
    "Again, what he did was despicable, but I do wonder..."
    mc "I can't believe I forgot to mention this, but this is the first time he hit you, right? That's what I had been getting from what you said."
    n "This is the first time he had hit me, yes."
    n "Back when he and my mom first got married, they agreed they would never use violence to get a point across if they ever had kids."
    n 12bf "I wonder how s-she would feel about all this..."
