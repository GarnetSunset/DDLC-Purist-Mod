# DDLC-Toolkit
A toolkit for Dan Salvato's DDLC.

Chrome is required, or you can retool it for firefox, but I'm a lazy bastard.

## Cloning the repo for noobies

Use the command "git clone --recursive https://github.com/GarnetSunset/DDLC-Toolkit" when cloning please!

## Running it.

Setup.bat for now. I'll add a couple steps to migrate your changes manually in the future.
